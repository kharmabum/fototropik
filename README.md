# fototropik

This project contains raw (primarily markdown) artifacts and a small number of scripts and libraries to support my [personal website].

The site is packaged with [Jekyll] a static site generator. This means I can write mostly plain [markdown] files and Jeykll does the work of producing styled, html web pages.

I use [Github Pages] to host the site, [Google Domains] as a domain name registrar, and [B2 Cloud Storage] to host large static assets (images, video, PDFs, etc).

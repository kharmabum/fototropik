Tell a wise person or else keep silent,  
for those who do not understand  
will mock it right away.  
I praise what is truly alive,  
what longs to be burned to death…

…And so long as you have not experienced this:  
to die and so to grow,  
you are only a troubled guest  
on the dark earth.

— Johann Wolfgang von Goethe

Tonight we will have a party  
Only for the broken pieces.

Only the crooked and the blunt ones  
Are welcome tonight;

The shattered and the stained can come,

But you perfected ones should stay away.

All the orphans and exiles  
Will be arriving soon with their  
Bundles of rags and sorrow.  
Make room, you bright angels:  
Now the wounded are coming home.

Tonight will be a celebration of our tragedies  
And our petty stupidities,  
Our shameful transgressions,  
The unedifying failure  
To become what we might have been  
In other, more radiant lives.

Here are the unrelinquished griefs  
And the never-forgiven slights;  
Here is the stuttering clumsiness  
And all the stagnant laziness.

Here is the hollow  
In my heart.  
Come in.  
Welcome.

I’m so glad you’re here.  
Outside, the Buddhas  
And the Saints are laughing.  
In here, there is a quieter  
Communion of our tragedies.  
Sit.

There is food and cheap wine,  
A warm fire and candles.  
Eat. Drink. Then speak,  
And we will all weep  
Sticky and graceless tears.

At this party, we are dancing  
To the tune of ten thousand folksongs,  
Each one of imperfection  
And darkly holy for it.  
This is the party for the broken.  
Imperfect music plays  
For imperfect dancers.

Imperfect speeches are  
Imperfectly spoken.

We bang tables and forget  
Our words and  
Wash the floor with our tears.  
You shattered and stained beauties,  
All crooked and graceless as you are,  
Blunted by the hard world of death,  
Love and the push of time’s spear;

You who are more glorious than statues,  
As rich in stories as pirates,  
As worthy as comets or stars,

This is the secret I want,  
Tonight, to tell you:  
Our dark-tongued singing  
Reaches heavens even the Saints don’t know;  
Our graceless, defiant dancing  
Opens up the whole Universe.

The broken world is our country.  
The struggle is our homeland.  
Tonight, let the Buddhas be silent;  
In here, we will raise our glasses  
To our brokenness, howl  
And sing so loud and badly  
That all the bright and dark  
Heavens will hear our song.

― Tom Hirons, Party for the Broken

Having loved enough and lost enough  
I am no longer searching  
Just opening,  
No longer trying to make sense of pain  
But trying to be a soft and sturdy home  
In which real things can land.  
These are the irritations  
That rub into a pearl.  
So we can talk for awhile  
But then we must listen  
The way rocks listen to the sea.  
And we can churn at all that goes wrong  
But then we must lay all distractions  
Down and water every living seed.  
And yes, on nights like tonight  
I too feel alone. But seldom do I  
Face it squarely enough  
To see it’s a door  
Into the endless breath  
That has no breather,  
Into the surf that human  
Shells call Goddess.

― Mark Nepo

All the true vows  
are secret vows  
the ones we speak out loud  
are the ones we break.

There is only one life  
you can call your own  
and a thousand others  
you can call by any name you want.

Hold to the truth you make  
every day with your own body,  
don't turn your face away.

Hold to your own truth  
at the center of the image  
you were born with.

Those who do not understand  
their destiny will never understand  
the friends they have made  
nor the work they have chosen

nor the one life that waits  
beyond all the others.

By the lake in the wood  
in the shadows  
you can  
whisper that truth  
to the quiet reflection  
you see in the water.

Whatever you hear from  
the water, remember,

it wants you to carry  
the sound of its truth on your lips.

Remember,  
in this place  
no one can hear you

and out of the silence  
you can make a promise  
it will kill you to break,

that way you'll find  
what is real and what is not.

I know what I am saying.  
Time almost forsook me  
and I looked again.

Seeing my reflection  
I broke a promise  
and spoke  
for the first time  
after all these years

in my own voice,

before it was too late  
to turn my face again.

― David Whyte, All the True Vows

I said to my soul, be still, and wait without hope  
For hope would be hope for the wrong thing; wait without love  
For love would be love of the wrong thing; there is yet faith  
But the faith and love and the hope are all in the waiting.  
Wait without thought, for you are not ready for thought:  
So the darkness shall be the light, and the stillness the dancing.

― T.S. Eliot

I keep pulling it out –  
the old map of my inner path  
I squint closely at it,  
trying to see some hidden road  
that maybe I’ve missed,  
but there’s nothing there now  
except some well-travelled paths.  
they have seen my footsteps often,  
held my laughter, caught my tears.

I keep going over the old map  
but now the roads lead nowhere,  
a meaningless wilderness  
where life is dull and futile.

“toss away the old map,” she says  
“you must be kidding!” I reply.  
she looks at me with Sarah eyes  
and repeats “toss it away.  
It’s of no use where you’re going.”

“I have to have a map!” I cry,  
“even if it takes me nowhere.  
I can’t be without direction,”

“but you are without direction,”  
she says, “so why not let go, be free?”

so there I am – tossing away the old map,  
sadly fearfully, putting it behind me.  
“whatever will I do?” wails my security  
“trust me” says my midlife soul.  
no map, no specific directions,  
no “this way ahead” or “take a left”.  
how will l know where to go?  
how will I find my way? no map!  
but then my midlife soul whispers  
“there was a time before maps  
when pilgrims travelled by the stars.”

It is time for the pilgrim in me  
to travel in the dark,  
to learn to read the stars  
that shine in my soul.  
I will walk deeper  
into the dark of my night.  
I will wait for the stars.  
trust their guidance.  
and let their light be enough for me.

― Joyce Rupp, Old Maps No Longer Work

Your great mistake is to act the drama  
as if you were alone. As if life  
were a progressive and cunning crime  
with no witness to the tiny hidden  
transgressions. To feel abandoned is to deny  
the intimacy of your surroundings. Surely,  
even you, at times, have felt the grand array;  
the swelling presence, and the chorus, crowding  
out your solo voice. You must note  
the way the soap dish enables you,  
or the window latch grants you freedom.  
Alertness is the hidden discipline of familiarity.  
The stairs are your mentor of things  
to come, the doors have always been there  
to frighten you and invite you,  
and the tiny speaker in the phone  
is your dream-ladder to divinity.  
Put down the weight of your aloneness and ease into the  
conversation. The kettle is singing  
even as it pours you a drink, the cooking pots  
have left their arrogant aloofness and  
seen the good in you at last. All the birds  
and creatures of the world are unutterably  
themselves. Everything is waiting for you.

― David Whyte, Everything is Waiting for You

I want a word that means  
okay and not okay,  
more than that: a word that means  
devastated and stunned with joy.  
I want the word that says  
I feel it all all at once.  
The heart is not like a songbird  
singing only one note at a time,  
more like a Tuvan throat singer  
able to sing both a drone  
and simultaneously  
two or three harmonics high above it—  
a sound, the Tuvans say,  
that gives the impression  
of wind swirling among rocks.  
The heart understands swirl,  
how the churning of opposite feelings  
weaves through us like an insistent breeze  
leads us wordlessly deeper into ourselves,  
blesses us with paradox  
so we might walk more openly  
into this world so rife with devastation,  
this world so ripe with joy.

― Rosemary Trommer, For When People Ask

More than once when I  
Sat all alone, revolving in myself  
The word that is the symbol of myself,  
The mortal limit of the Self was loosed,  
And passed into the nameless, as a cloud  
Melts into heaven. I touch’d my limbs, the limbs  
Were strange, not mine—and yet no shade of doubt,  
But utter clearness, and thro’ loss of Self  
The gain of such large life as matched with ours  
Were sun to spark—unshadowable in words,  
Themselves but shadows of a shadow-world”

― Alfred Lord Tennyson

Let not a person revive the past  
Or on the future build his hopes;  
For the past has been left behind  
And the future has not been reached.  
Instead with insight let him see  
[Each presently arisen state](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs12671-014-0333-z.pdf);  
Let him know that and be sure of it,  
Invincibly, unshakably.  
Today effort must be made;  
Tomorrow Death may come, who knows?  
No bargain with Mortality  
Can keep him and his hordes away,  
But one who dwells thus ardently,  
Relentlessly, by day and night—  
It is he, the Peaceful Sage has said,  
Who has had a single excellent night.

― Majjhima Nikaya (MN:131)

This is what you shall do: Love the earth and sun and the animals, despise riches, give alms to every one that asks, stand up for the stupid and crazy, devote your income and labor to others, hate tyrants, argue not concerning God, have patience and indulgence toward the people, take off your hat to nothing known or unknown or to any man or number of men, go freely with powerful uneducated persons and with the young and with the mothers of families, read these leaves in the open air every season of every year of your life, reexamine all you have been told at school or church or in any book, dismiss whatever insults your own soul, and your very flesh shall be a great poem and have the richest fluency not only in its words but in the silent lines of its lips and face and between the lashes of your eyes and in every motion and joint of your body.

Ah! vainest of all things  
Is the gratitude of kings;  
The plaudits of the crowd  
Are but the clatter of feet.

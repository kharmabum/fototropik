My name is Juan-Carlos Foust, and I am an engineer currently living in the Pacific Northwest. The majority of my professional experience resolves building native mobile, web, backend, and data/ML software products in a variety of industries and contexts including healthcare, energy, consumer tech, IoT, and start-ups.

I volunteer for East Bay Meditation Center and the Burning Man Technology, Ranger, and GP&E departments and I serve as a mentor for Hack the Hood and Insight Data Science's DEI (Diversity, Equity, Inclusion) Program.

Outside of work and volunteering, I enjoy reading, cooking, surfing, woodworking, and travel.

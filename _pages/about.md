Hola. My name is Juan-Carlos Foust. I was born in Puerto Rico and raised in the southeastern United States. My mother's family is Puerto Rican descended from Spanish and Taino. My father is descended from German, Irish, and Cherokee. I moved to California in 2009 and have called the Olympic Peninsula in Washington state home since October 2020.

I'm an organizer within the [Port Townsend Psychedelic Society][ptps] and [REACH WA](https://reachwa.org) (the Responsible Entheogen Access and Community Healing Coalition), an ambassador to the [Heroic Hearts Project](https://www.heroicheartsproject.org), and a contributing writer to [HowToUsePsychedelics.com](https://HowToUsePsychedelics.com).

I also work as an engineer at [Zymergen] (now [Ginkgo Bioworks][ginkgo]) where I build tools to communicate with microscopic organisms, teaching them how to sustainably produce useful compounds such as medicines without reliance on fossil fuels as feedstock.

I am student of all my relations, scripture, mythology, and deep presence. I believe we are here to be compassionate and to help the universe know itself.

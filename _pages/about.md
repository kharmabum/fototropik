My name is Juan-Carlos Foust. I am an engineer living in the Pacific Northwest and a citizen of the world, aloha. The majority of my professional experience involves building native mobile, web, backend, and data/ML software products in a variety of industries and contexts including healthcare, energy, consumer tech, IoT, and start-ups.

I volunteer for Burning Man's Technology, Ranger, and GP&E departments and serve as a mentor at [Hack the Hood] and [Insight DEI].

Outside of work and volunteering, I enjoy reading, cooking, surfing, woodworking, and travel.

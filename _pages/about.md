My name is Juan-Carlos Foust, and I am an engineer currently living in the San Francisco Bay Area. I have about eight years of experience building software in a variety of industries and contexts including healthcare, consumer tech, IoT, and start-ups. If you need help working on an iOS project, you can [hire me](/hire-me).

I also volunteer for East Bay Meditation Center; Hack the Hood, and the Burning Man Technology, Ranger, and GP&E departments.

Outside of work and volunteering, I like to cook, surf, and travel.

Hola. My name is Juan-Carlos Foust. I was born in Ceiba, Puerto Rico and raised in the southeastern United States. My mother's family is Puerto Rican descended from Spanish and Taino. My father is descended from German, Celtic, and Cherokee. I moved to California in 2009 but have called the Olympic Peninsula in Washington state home since October 2020. I'm currently living between Mexico City with my wife and the San Francisco Bay Area where I work.

Professionally, I try to develop software that supports the foundations of a more just and regenerative civilization.

Personally, I am student of all my relations, scripture, mythology, and deep presence.

I believe we are here to practice kindness and to recall our innate goodness and divine nature.

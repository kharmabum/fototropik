Aloha. My name is Juan-Carlos Foust. I was born in Puerto Rico and raised in the southeastern United States. My mother's family is Puerto Rican descended from Spanish. My father's American descended from German and Irish. I moved to California in 2009 and have called the Olympic Peninsula in Washington state home since October 2020. Much of my personal time is spent volunteering with the [Port Townsend Psychedelic Society][ptps]Â and [REACH WA](https://reachwa.org), the Responsible Entheogen Access and Community Healing Coalition. As an engineer at [Ginkgo Bioworks][ginkgo], I build tools to train microscopic organisms how to more sustainably produce useful compounds without reliance on fossil fuels as feedstock. From 2019-2022 I helped accelerate the decarbonization of our electrical grid by developing energy trading systems for sources of renewable power. I believe we are here to be compassionate and to help the universe know itself.

I also volunteer for Burning Man's Technology, Ranger, and GP&E departments. Outside of work and volunteering, I enjoy reading, traveling, movement, and stillness.

My name is Juan-Carlos Foust. I was born in Puerto Rico and raised in the southeastern United States. My mother's family is Puerto Rican descended from Spanish and Taino. My father is descended from German, Celtic, and Cherokee. I moved to California in 2009 and have called the Olympic Peninsula in Washington state home since October 2020. I'll be moving bay the San Francisco Bay Area in November of 2024.

I'm a core volunteer within the [Port Townsend Psychedelic Society][ptps], co-founder of [REACH WA](https://reachwa.org) (the Responsible Entheogen Access and Community Healing Coalition), an ambassador to the [Heroic Hearts Project](https://www.heroicheartsproject.org), and a contributing writer to [HowToUsePsychedelics.com](https://HowToUsePsychedelics.com).

Professionally, I work as a software engineer where I lead the delivery of complex, ambitious projects which support the foundations of a more just and regenerative civilization.

I am student of scripture, mythology, deep presence, and all my relations. I believe we are here to be kind and to help ourselves and future generations grow in self-awareness and love.

My name is Juan-Carlos Foust. I was born in Puerto Rico and raised in the southeastern United States. My mother's family is Puerto Rican descended from Spanish and Taino. My father is descended from German, Celtic, and Cherokee. I moved to California in 2009 but have called the Olympic Peninsula in Washington state home since October 2020. I'm currently back for another chapter in the San Francisco Bay Area.

Professionally, I develop software that supports the foundations of a more just and regenerative civilization.

I am student of scripture, mythology, deep presence, and all my relations. I believe we are here to be kind and to help ourselves and future generations grow in self-awareness and love.

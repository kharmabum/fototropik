> First, I am water.

<br>

> In the name of the daybreak

> And the eyelids of morning

> And the wayfaring moon

> And the night when it departs

> I swear I will not dishonor my soul with hatred

> But offer myself humbly

> As a guardian of nature

> As a healer of misery

> As a messenger of wonder

> As an architect of peace

> In the name of the sun and its mirrors

> And the day that embraces it

> And the cloud veils drawn over it

> And the uttermost night

> And the male and the female

> And the plants bursting with seed

> And the crowning seasons of the firefly and the apple

> I will honor all life

> Wherever and in whatever form it may dwell

> On Earth my home

> And in the mansions of the stars

– School Prayer

<br>

> I bow with humility

> I bow with respect and gratitude

> I bow to face my own imperfection and surrender

– The Three Prostrations

> With a wish to free all beings

> I shall always go for refuge

> To the Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha

> Until I reach full Enlightenment

> Enthused by wisdom and compassion

> Today in the Buddha' presence

> I generate the mind for full awakening

> For the benefit of all sentient beings

> As long as space endures

> As long as sentient beings remain

> Until then, may I too remain

> And dispel the miseries of the world.

– Kundun's Prayer

– Boddhisattva Vows

<br>


> May I be the protector to those without protection

> A leader for those who journey

> And a boat, a bridge, a passage

> For those desiring the further shore.

> May the pain of every living creature

> Be completely cleared away.

> May I be the doctor and the medicine

> And may I be the nurse

> For all sick beings in the world

> Until everyone is healed

> Just like space

> And the great elements such as Earth

> May I always support the Life

> Of all the boundless creatures

> And until they pass away from pain

> May I also be the source of life

> For all the realms of varied beings

> That reach unto the ends of space.

– Shantideva's Prayer
